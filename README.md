#Standardized Testing Participation Exploration

For this project, I examined the data for both the SAT and ACT exams,  and performed an exploratory data analysis on the participation rates for both of these exams. The task was to make recommendations on how to increase SAT participation rates. After cleaning and organizing each data set and merging them into one data set using pandas functions, comparisons could be made between the scores of different subjects of both exams. After examining the correlations between the two exams, it seems that there were mostly negative correlations between scores for different subjects. This means that if a student takes both exams, that student will score high on one exam, and will score low on the other. Research on different states and their policies on giving out the SAT showed that for the states that had high participation rates without the SAT being mandatory, they implemented an SAT School Day that allows all 11th grade students to take the SAT for free on a school day. This day is held every year, and should be spread to all states in order to raise participation rates.
